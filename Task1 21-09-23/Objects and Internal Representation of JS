Objects are the building blocks of JavaScript
There are different data types that store a single value each

Objects can contain a combination of data-types as well as reference data-types

objects in javascript my be defined as an unordered collection of related data in the form of "KEY:Value" pairs.
These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods.

the bracket notation for an object will be [],{} etc..
and the data types are string, Number, Boolean, undefined etc....

creating javascript object with a constructor means that we can give an option of what kind of data types to store in the objects and 
to call the constructor to a function and give a data of any type defined inside the object.
