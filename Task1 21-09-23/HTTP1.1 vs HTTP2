HTTP1.1 vs HTTP 2



HTTP1.1
The first HTTP came across many stages of development, so it is named as HTTP 1.1 . 

It goes with one by one content delivery, so that means, 
if one of the Content fails, 
then the other contents will not be delivered to the client from the server




HTTP 2:
This is a new Upgraded version of HTTP1.1, where all the contents can be delivered in one time and 
it can be delivered as per the command by the Developer, 
to show which content should be shown first and last.


It gives a several streams of data at one time.
It does with a 
single TCP connection(Transmission Control Protocol) where it does with error checking and other possibilities that an IP cannot do.


The difference between the both the HTTP are the performance, which is 

Multiplexing

Server Push

Header Compression




HTTP 3 is being developed and tested with few sites with the use of new QUIC method.
