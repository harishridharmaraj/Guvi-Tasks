Difference between Window and document objects:

the window is at the top level and the root object of the Website or a page and
it has the document to do things as (DOM)Document Object Model.

A document inside the Window can be as HTML, PHP, JS etc...
A Window Object can be as inner height and width and caches

which can be specifically called as window.propertyname to change the value of the Property that is present in the Window.
and the document can be accessed by window.document.propertyname

For ex: in CSS
*{
color:Blue
}
all the colors of the font, SVG, will be turned to a Blue color.

and in Javascript for the document:
document.getElementById("id") to change.
